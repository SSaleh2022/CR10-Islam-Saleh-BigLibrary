# CR10-Islam-Saleh-BigLibrary

Task: As a Full Stack Web Developer you got your first full-stack project, the Big Library web application. The customer wants you to create a big list of all media available in the library (books, CDs, DVDs) and make it available over the web.


The information that you will need to have in your DataBase is:

Consider them as columns for the table(*):

Media: title, image (HTTP link to an image), author, ISBN code, short_description, publish_date, publisher, and type (book, CD, DVD). Additionally, status (“available” or “reserved”; required for Bonus Points)

Author: first_name, last_name

Publisher: name, address, size (“big”, “medium”, “small”);


For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(20) Create a database and name it: CR10-YourName-BigLibrary. The database must have the name as specified in this task! 

*Only one table is required for this CodeReview although the information required above is separated by entities. Feel free to expand and create more tables if you feel confident enough in creating the relationships between them.

(5) Add test data: at least 10 entries 

(20) Display List of Media: Fetch the media data from your database and display it on the browser.

(15) User-Friendly GUI: Create web-pages with a nice design using the Bootstrap framework or just HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

(20) Insert form for Media: Create an inserting form for Media. A user should be able to insert data into the database over the front-end form.

(10) Update form for Media: Create a form for updating Media.

(10) Delete Media: A user should be able to delete Media from the database by clicking on the Delete button.

Bonus Points:

(10) You should create a button - "show media", that will be displayed together with every Media shown on the list. Once that button is clicked, all details regarding that specific Media (title, author, ISBN, short_description, and status (available or reserved) will be displayed on a new web page.

(10) Create a list of Publishers. When you click on a Publisher name, a user should be able to see the list of Media that “belong” to this specific Publisher.

Note: Don’t forget to upload the php code together with your database .sql file to the GitHub repository. Please organize your project content (files) into folders according to their type.
